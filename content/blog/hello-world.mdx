# Welcome to My New Blog 🚀

This is a sample post written in **MDX**. It supports *Markdown* and potentially React components.

## Why OOPS in Frontend?

Many developers think **Object Oriented Programming** is only for backend. But with modern frameworks:

1.  **Components** are basically Classes (Encapsulation).
2.  **Hooks** provide Abstraction.
3.  **Composition** is easier than Inheritance.

```typescript
const hello = (name: string) => {
  console.log(\`Hello \${name}\`);
}
```

Stay tuned for more deep dives into System Architecture!
